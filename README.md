# Description
The Heart Attack Risk Classification project is dedicated to predicting the risk of heart attacks using machine learning. This project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and in-depth evaluation. We use a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) with a linear kernel as the final model and employ various visualization techniques, including Plots,ROC curves and confusion matrices.

# Data
Dataset: Heart Attack Risk Dataset
Number of Samples: 303
Number of Features: 13
Target Variable: output (0 for No, 1 for Yes)
Data Cleaning
Handling missing values
Feature scaling
Data imputation
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA phase included an extensive exploration of the dataset. Key visualizations and analyses were performed:

Distribution of the target variable
Correlation analysis
Feature importance
# Model Selection and Evaluation
We considered several machine learning models, including SVC, XGBoost, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). After rigorous evaluation, the SVC model with a linear kernel was selected as the final model.

Initial model selection
Model evaluation
Reasons for choosing the SVC model with a linear kernel
# Visualization Techniques
Visualization techniques played a crucial role in assessing model performance. We employed ROC curves and confusion matrices to gain deeper insights into classification results.

ROC Curves: Visual representations of ROC curves for model evaluation
Confusion Matrices: Visualizations of confusion matrices to analyze model performance
